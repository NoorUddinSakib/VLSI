### üëã Introduction

Welcome to my VLSI projects repository! This collection showcases my hands-on work in the field of integrated circuit design and verification.

* **Background:** I hold a degree in Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from United International University
. My academic studies provided me with a strong theoretical foundation in digital logic, semiconductor physics, and microelectronics.

* **Recent Activity:** Currently, I am doing my Master's in Micro and Nanotechnology at TU Ilmenau. I have been actively applying and expanding my skills by working on full-custom layouts for a variety of digital and analog blocks. My recent focus has been on mastering the end-to-end physical design flow using industry-standard EDA tools like Cadence Virtuoso. Each project involves schematic design, layout implementation, and rigorous physical verification (DRC and LVS) to ensure design integrity and manufacturability.
